# Intlayer Content Management System (CMS) Documentation

<iframe title="Visual Editor + CMS for Your Web App: Intlayer Explained" class="m-auto aspect-[16/9] w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border-0" allow="autoplay; gyroscope;" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDDTnirwi_4?autoplay=0&amp;origin=http://intlayer.org&amp;controls=0&amp;rel=1"/>

The Intlayer CMS is am Application that allows you to externalize your content of an Intlayer project.

For that, Intlayer introduce the concept of 'distant dictionaries'.

![Intlayer CMS Interface](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/assets/CMS.png)

## Understanding distant dictionaries

Intlayer make a difference between 'local' and 'distant' dictionaries.

- A 'local' dictionary is a dictionary that is declared in your Intlayer project. Such as the declaration file of a button, or your navigation bar. Externalizing your content do not make sense in this case because this content is not supposed to change often.

- A 'distant' dictionary is a dictionary that is managed through the Intlayer CMS. It could be useful to allow your team to manage your content in direct on your website, and also aims to use A/B testing features and SEO automatic optimization.

## Visual editor vs CMS

The [Intlayer Visual](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_visual_editor.md) editor is a tool that allows you to manage your content in a visual editor for local dictionaries. Once a change is made, the content will be replaced in the code-base. That means that the application will be rebuilt and the page will be reloaded to display the new content.

In contrast, the Intlayer CMS is a tool that allows you to manage your content in a visual editor for distant dictionaries. Once a change is made, the content will **not** impact your code-base. And the website will automatically display the changed content.

## Configuration

In your Intlayer configuration file, you can customize the CMS settings:

```typescript fileName="intlayer.config.ts" codeFormat="typescript"
import type { IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  // ... other configuration settings
  editor: {
    /**
     * Required
     *
     * The URL of the application.
     * This is the URL targeted by the visual editor.
     */
    applicationURL: process.env.INTLAYER_APPLICATION_URL,

    /**
     * Required
     *
     * Client ID and client secret are required to enable the editor.
     * They allow the identify the user who is editing the content.
     * They can be obtained by creating a new client in the Intlayer Dashboard - Projects (https://intlayer.org/dashboard/projects).

     * The URL of the Intlayer CMS.

     */
    cmsURL: process.env.INTLAYER_CMS_URL,

    clientId: process.env.INTLAYER_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.INTLAYER_CLIENT_SECRET,

```javascript fileName="intlayer.config.cjs" codeFormat="commonjs"
/** @type {import('intlayer').IntlayerConfig} */
const config = {

  editor: {
    /**
     * Required
     *
     * The URL of the application.

    backendURL: process.env.INTLAYER_BACKEND_URL,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

> If you don't have a client ID and client secret, you can obtain them by creating a new client in the [Intlayer Dashboard - Projects](https://intlayer.org/dashboard/projects).

> To see all available parameters, refer to the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/configuration.md).

## Using the CMS

### Push your configuration

To configure the Intlayer CMS, you can use the [intlayer CLI](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/docs/en/intlayer_cli.md) commands.

```bash
npx intlayer config push
```

> If you use environment variables in your `intlayer.config.ts` configuration file, you can specify the desired environment using the `--env` argument:

```bash
npx intlayer config push --env production
```

This command uploads your configuration to the Intlayer CMS.

### Push a dictionary

To transform your locale dictionaries in a distant dictionary, you can use the [intlayer CLI](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/tree/main/docs/en/intlayer_cli.md) commands.

```bash
npx intlayer dictionary push -d my-first-dictionary-key
```

> If you use environment variables in your `intlayer.config.ts` configuration file, you can specify the desired environment using the `--env` argument:

```bash
npx intlayer dictionary push -d my-first-dictionary-key --env production
```

This command uploads your initial content dictionaries, making them available for asynchronous fetching and editing through the Intlayer platform.

### Edit the dictionary

Then you will be able to see and manage your dictionary in the [Intlayer CMS](https://intlayer.org/dashboard/content).

## Hot reloading

The Intlayer CMS is able to hot reload the dictionaries when a change is detected.

Without the hot reloading, a new build of the application will be needed to display the new content.

By activating the [`liveSync`](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/configuration#editor-configuration) configuration, the application will automatically replace the updated content when it is detected.

```typescript fileName="intlayer.config.ts" codeFormat="typescript"
import type { IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  // ... other configuration settings
  editor: {
    // ... other configuration settings

    /**
     * Indicates if the application should hot reload the locale configurations when a change is detected.
     * For example, when a new dictionary is added or updated, the application will update the content tu display in the page.
     *
     * Because the hot reloading needs an continuous connection to the server, it is only available for clients of the `enterprise` plan
     *
     * Default: false
     */
    liveSync: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

```javascript fileName="intlayer.config.mjs" codeFormat="esm"
/** @type {import('intlayer').IntlayerConfig} */
const config = {
  // ... other configuration settings
  editor: {
    // ... other configuration settings

    /**
     * Indicates if the application should hot reload the locale configurations when a change is detected.
     * For example, when a new dictionary is added or updated, the application will update the content tu display in the page.
     *
     * Because the hot reloading needs an continuous connection to the server, it is only available for clients of the `enterprise` plan
     *
     * Default: false
     */
    liveSync: true,
  },
};

export default config;
```

```javascript fileName="intlayer.config.cjs" codeFormat="commonjs"
/** @type {import('intlayer').IntlayerConfig} */
const config = {
  // ... other configuration settings
  editor: {
    // ... other configuration settings

    /**
     * Indicates if the application should hot reload the locale configurations when a change is detected.
     * For example, when a new dictionary is added or updated, the application will update the content tu display in the page.
     *
     * Because the hot reloading needs an continuous connection to the server, it is only available for clients of the `enterprise` plan
     *
     * Default: false
     */
    liveSync: true,
  },
};

module.exports = config;
```

The hot reloading replace the content in both server and client side.

- On the server side, you should ensure that the application process has the write access to the `.intlayer/dictionaries` directory.
- On the client side, the hot reloading allow the application to hot reload the content in the browser, without needing to reload the page. However, this feature is only available for clients components.

> Because the hot reloading needs an continuous connection to the server using an `EventListener`, it is only available for clients of the `enterprise` plan.

## Debug

If you encounter any issues with the CMS, check the following:

- The application is running.

- The [`editor`](https://intlayer.org/doc/concept/configuration#editor-configuration) configuration are correctly set in your Intlayer configuration file.
  - Required fields:
    - The application URL should match the one you set in the editor configuration (`applicationURL`).
    - The CMS URL

- Ensure that the project configuration was pushed to the Intlayer CMS.

- The visual editor use an iframe to display your website. Ensure that the Content Security Policy (CSP) of your website allows the CMS url as `frame-ancestors` ('https://intlayer.org' by default). Check the editor console for any error.
